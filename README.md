### Technologies Used
Frontend
*
To create the website I used React and Redux in order to create components that render onto the screen as well as send API calls to multiple databases. I used Ruby on Rails in the backend in order to handle authentication of users, receive calls from the frontend, and to send data back to the react elements. In order to store information on the user's stocks, watchlist info, etc. Postgresql was used.

### Features
#### Stocks
Users can see data represented by linegraphs and dynamically change the graph data by changing the timeframe of the stock. Users can also buy and sell stocks on market orders and see the number of shares they bought as well as the average price of their holding. 
#### Watchlists
